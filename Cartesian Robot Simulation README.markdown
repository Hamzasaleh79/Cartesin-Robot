# Cartesian Robot Simulation using Simscape Multibody

## Overview
This repository contains a MATLAB-based simulation of a Cartesian robot designed using Simscape Multibody. The project demonstrates dynamic modeling and control of a 3-axis robotic system, showcasing precise motion control and trajectory planning for industrial automation applications.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Modeling**: Accurate 3D model of a Cartesian robot built with Simscape Multibody, incorporating physical properties like mass, inertia, and joint constraints.
- **Visualization**: Real-time 3D visualization of robot dynamics using MATLAB’s Simscape mechanics explorer.
- **Modularity**: Reusable code structure for easy modification and integration with other control algorithms or hardware.

## Technologies Used
- **MATLAB**: Core simulation environment for numerical computation.
- **Simscape Multibody**: For physical modeling and dynamic simulation of the robot.
- **MATLAB Visualization Tools**: For rendering 3D motion and analyzing performance metrics.

## Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites**: MATLAB (R2020a or later) with Simscape Multibody and Control System Toolbox installed.
2. **Installation**: Clone the repository and open the `.slx` file in MATLAB.
3. **Usage**: Run the main script (`cartesian_robot_sim.m`) to simulate the robot’s motion. Adjust parameters in the script for custom trajectories or control settings.
4. **Output**: View the robot’s motion in the Simscape Mechanics Explorer and analyze performance via generated plots.

## Applications
- Industrial automation research
- Robotics control system development
- Educational tool for learning multibody dynamics and control
